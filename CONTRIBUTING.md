Guidelines for Contributing
---------------------------

Airsonic development is a community project, and contributions are welcomed. Here are a few guidelines you should follow before submitting:

  1.  **License Acceptance** All contributions must be licensed as [GNU GPLv3](https://github.com/airsonic/airsonic/blob/develop/LICENSE.txt) to be accepted. Use [`git commit --signoff`](https://jk.gs/git-commit.html) to acknowledge this.
  2.  **No Breakage** New features or changes to existing ones must not degrade the user experience. This means do not introduce bugs, remove functionality, or make large changes to existing themes/UI without prior discussion in an Issue.
  3.  **Coding standards** Language best-practices should be followed, comment generously, and avoid "clever" algorithms. It does not do simple refactoring. It is because it hinders Airsonic's follow-up.
  4.  **I will fix it!** I love you. Plese try [submiting a patch](https://github.com/tesshucom/jpsonic/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Apatches-welcome) for an open Issue.
  5.  **Good thought that!** If you would like to have ideas and suggestions on Japanese processing at ease, fill in the comments on the author's site. Let's go easy. I love you. I said twice.
